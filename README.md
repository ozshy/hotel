R-code for numerical simulations used in section 6 of a paper entitled:
"Hotelling's model with firms located close to each other"
by Oz Shy

The file: hotel_2022_2_26.R provides the R-code for the computations and Figures 4, 5, and 6 that are displayed in section 6 of the paper. 
You will need to have R installed on your computer. 

The PDF file is not related to the R file. It is just like an online appendix that shows some derivations in greater detail. The PDF is printed from the .dfw math file which requires "Derive for Windows" software.
