R-code for numerical simulations used in section 6 of a paper entitled:
"Hotelling's model with firms located close to each other"
by Oz Shy

The file: hotel_2022_3_17.R provides the R-code for the computations and Figures 4, 5, and 6 that are displayed in section 6 of the paper. 
You will need to have R installed on your computer. 

Note: The last (unfinished) figure generated by the R file is not in the paper and therefore should be ingored. The sole purpose is for me (the author) to verify that I can create a mirror image of Figure 6 where the location of firm A is fixed at a=0.5 and firm B varies its location between 0.5 and 1. Recall that in Figure 6 in the paper assumes that B is located at 0.5 and A's location varies between 0 and 0.5. 

The PDF file is not related to the R file. It is just like an online appendix that shows some derivations in greater detail. The PDF is printed from the .dfw math file which requires "Derive for Windows" software.
